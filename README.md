# jsonBasicsJava
A simple java program to understand the working of creation and reading the json file in java. 

This is a simple java code that i used to understand how can we create a json file and write it to local directory.
The code also reads the file and display the contents inside json file.
This was done to simply understand the working of json files, for the purpose of learning in my company.
